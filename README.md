# roboadivser

A simple robo advisor example providing a web interface for scenario-based investment and feature search. See `app.py` for the implementation. To clone the repository with the `work` branch if it exists, run `python clone_repo.py <repo_url>`.

## Running
1. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The app uses Gradio and will print a public URL when `share=True`.
